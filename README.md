# CryptoNet
A real-time visualizer of crypto coins built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TailWind CSS. The app fetches the top 10 cryptocurrencies from the CoinGecko API and displays them with dynamic updates, including rank, current price, price change over the last 24 hours and market cap porcentage. It also provides visual indicators for performance and features light and dark modes, along with a responsive navigation bar.

# What I learned

* Reinforced skills in fetching real-time data from an external API, and dynamically updating the page.
* Strengthened understanding of implementing a burger menu with JavaScript for mobile responsiveness.
* Applied conditional rendering techniques to display performance indicators based on market performance.
* Styling with Tailwind CSS for responsive design and layout, and enhancing the page with Lottie animations.
* Building a light and dark mode.
